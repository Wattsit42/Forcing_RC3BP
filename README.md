The code contained in this repository is broadly the same as the code in the Final_Simulations repository. Although here I include the code needed to generate animations and an updated general integrator class.
This also repository also contains a settings file which contains some omitted experiments which may be of additional interest.
For instructions on how to set the program up please see the main python file.
